# React Native Todo List App
# Todo Master - Your Productivity, Simplified

## 📌 Overview
This is a simple **React Native Todo List App** built using **Redux Toolkit** for state management, **AsyncStorage** for persistence and **React Spring** for animations.

---

## 🚀 Setup Instructions
### 1️⃣ Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ChamikaD97/todo-master
cd todo-master
```

### 2️⃣ Install Dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

### 3️⃣ Link Native Dependencies (for React Native CLI, NOT Expo)
```bash
npx react-native link
```

### 4️⃣ Run the Application

```bash
npm start
```

## 📦 Dependencies Used
- **Redux Toolkit (@reduxjs/toolkit)** - For state management
- **React-Redux (react-redux)** - Redux integration with React Native
- **AsyncStorage (@react-native-async-storage/async-storage)** - For persisting todo data
- **React Spring (@react-spring/native)** - For animations

---

## 🛠 Features Implemented
✅ Add new todos  
✅ Mark todos as completed  
✅ Delete todos  
✅ Persist todos using AsyncStorage  
✅ Smooth animations with React Spring  
✅ Modular and maintainable code structure  


## 💡 Approach
1. **State Management**: Used Redux Toolkit to manage todos globally.
2. **Data Persistence**: Used AsyncStorage to save and load todos on app restart.
4. **Animations**: Used React Spring for smooth UI transitions.
5. **Code Organization**: Kept components and Redux logic separate for scalability.

---

## ⚠️ Challenges Faced
- **Redux Toolkit & AsyncStorage Integration**: Handling state updates and persistence together.
- **React Spring in React Native**: Managing animations efficiently.
- **React Native CLI Setup Issues**: Ensuring proper environment setup without Expo.
